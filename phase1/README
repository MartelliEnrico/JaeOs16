Phase 1

To build the phase1 .uarm files, you need to have uarm installed on your machine,
by default inside /usr/include/uarm for Linux systems, or /usr/local/include/uarm
for OS X.

You will also need the programs arm-none-eabi-gcc and arm-none-eabi-ld in your
path to compile.

Once uarm is installed, you need to call `make` to compile the sources, and
the files p1test.core.uarm and p1test.stab.uarm will be created.
If you installed uarm to a custom directory, call make passing the direcrory name
as a parameter like `make INCDIR=/my/custom/path`
